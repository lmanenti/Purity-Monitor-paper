abstract = {Abstract (100) and (110) single crystals of silver were cleaned by electron and argon-ion bombardment in ultra-high vacuum. The work functions of the bulk crystals, and of silver films formed upon them by autoepitaxy, were determined photoelectrically. The bulk crystals had work functions of (4.64 Â± 0.02) eV and (4.52 Â± 0.02) eV respectively. The effect of the deposition of silver films was to reduce the work function, but continued cycles of deposition and annealing at 500 to 600 K caused the work function to return to a value very close to that of the bulk crystal. An annealed film of silver deposited in stages on a mica substrate at 425 K had a work function of (4.72 Â± 0.02) eV, corresponding to that of the (111) silver surface. If the mica remained at room temperature during deposition, the work function was about 4.5 eV. The work function of a thick polycrystalline film of silver on quartz was (4.26 Â± 0.02) eV. The results support the Smoluchowski correlation of work function with surface atom density.},

Two methods were used: (a) photoelectric emission, and (b) the retarding potential technique. For a fresh gold film deposited at a temperature of about 50 Â°C the work function was 5.30 eV. After sintering at 200 Â°C it increased to 5.38 eV. For a gold film deposited at higher temperature the work function was 5.45 eV. Oxygen gas does not bring about a measurable change in the work function of gold at room temperature."
